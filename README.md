Utilities to make defining apis easier

## Tools

### datagenerator 

Class to generate random values given a json-schema.
Doesn't support all json-schema monstruousities, only a subset I find useful.
See TODO.md for what is likely to be implemented next.

## Dependencies

run init.sh in dependencies
